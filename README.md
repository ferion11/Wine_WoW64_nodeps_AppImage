# Wine_WoW64_nodeps_AppImage
> AppImage of Wine WoW64 without dependencies (just packing it with the running script).

####NOTE: As there is no dependency within this AppImage, it's recommended that you have already installed some version of wine multilib (32bits + 64bits) so the AppImage can use the same dependencies.
